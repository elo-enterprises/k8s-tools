### Container Dispatch

Let's look at a more complicated example where we want to use make to dispatch commands *into* the compose-service containers.  For this we'll have to change the boilerplate somewhat as we add more functionality.

```Makefile
# Makefile (make sure you have real tabs, not spaces)

include compose.mk
$(eval $(call compose.import, ▰, TRUE, docker-compose.yml))

# New target declaration that we can use to run stuff
# inside the `debian` container.  The syntax conventions
# are configured by the `compose.import` call we used above.
demo: ▰/debian/self.demo

# Displays platform info to show where target is running.
# Since this target is intended to be private, we will 
# prefix "self" to indicate it should not run on host.
self.demo:
	source /etc/os-release && printf "$${PRETTY_NAME}\n"
	uname -n -v
```

The example above demonstrates another automatically generated target that uses some special syntax: `▰/<svc_name>/<target_to_dispatch>`.  This is just syntactic sugar that says that running `make demo` on the host runs `make self.demo` on the debian container.  Calling the top-level target looks like this:

<img src="img/demo-dispatch.gif">

What just happend?  If we unpack the syntactic sugar even more, you could say that the following are roughly equivalent:

```bash
# pithy invocation with compose.mk
$ make demo

# the verbose alternative invocation
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml \
    run --entrypoint bash debian -c "make self.demo"
```

Let's add another target to demonstrate dispatch for multiple containers:

```Makefile
# Makefile (make sure you have real tabs, not spaces)

include compose.mk
$(eval $(call compose.import, ▰, TRUE, docker-compose.yml))

# User-facing top-level target, with two dependencies
demo-double-dispatch: ▰/debian/self.demo ▰/alpine/self.demo

# Displays platform info to show where target is running.
# Since this target is intended to be private, we will 
# prefix "self" to indicate it should not run on host.
self.demo:
	source /etc/os-release && printf "$${PRETTY_NAME}\n"
	uname -n -v
```

The *`self`* prefix is just a convention, more on that in the following sections.  The above looks pretty tidy though, and hopefully helps to illustrate how the target/container/callback association works.  Running that looks like this:

<img src="img/demo-double-dispatch.gif">


Meanwhile, the equivalent-but-expanded version below is getting cluttered, plus it breaks when files move or get refactored.

```bash
# pithy invocation with compose.mk
$ make demo-double-dispatch 

# verbose, fragile alternative
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml \
    run --entrypoint bash debian -c "make self.demo" \
  && docker compose -f docker-compose.yml \
    run --entrypoint bash alpine -c "make self.demo"
```

<ins>**This simple pattern for dispatching targets in containers is the main feature of `compose.mk` as a library, and it's surprisingly powerful.**</ins>  The next sections will cover macro arguments, and dispatch syntax/semantics in more detail.  If you're interested in a demo of how you can use this with k8s-tools.yml, you can skip to [this section](#cluster-automation-demo).

Container-dispatch with `compose.mk` can also autodetect what shell to use with the container (via the [`<svc_name>/get_shell` target](#target-compose_stemspecial)).  Even better, the Makefile-based approach scales to lots of utility-containers in separate compose files, and can detect and prevent whole categories of errors (like typos in the name of the compose-file, service name, entrypoint, etc) at the start of a hour-long process instead of somewhere in the middle.  (See [docs for `make --reconn`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Instead-of-Execution.html) to learn more about dry-runs).  If you are thoughtful about the ways that you're using volumes and file state, you can also consider using [`make --jobs` for parallel execution](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Parallel-Execution).

**To make this work as expected though, we do have to add more stuff to the compose file.**  In practice the containers you use might be ready, but if they are slim, perhaps not.  Basically, **if the subtarget is going to run on the container, the container needs to at least have:**  `make`, `bash` (or whatever shell the Makefile uses), and a volume mount to read the `Makefile`.  

```yaml
{{open('tests/docker-compose.yml','r').read()}}
```

The debian/alpine compose file above and most of the interfaces described so far are all exercised inside [this repo's test suite](tests/).
