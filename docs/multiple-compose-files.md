### Multiple Compose Files

This can be easily adapted for working with *multiple* compose files, but you'll have to think about service-name collisions between those files.  If you have two compose files with the same service name, you can use multiple target-namespaces like this:

```Makefile
# Makefile (Make sure you have real tabs, not spaces!)

# Load 1st compose file under paralleogram namespace,
# Load 2nd compose file under triangle namespace
include compose.mk
$(eval $(call compose.import, ▰, FALSE, my-compose-files/build-tools.yml))
$(eval $(call compose.import, ▲, FALSE, my-compose-files/cluster-tools.yml))

# Top-level "build" target that dispatches subtargets
# "build-code" and "build-cluster" on different containers
build: ▰/maven/build.code ▲/kubectl/build.cluster
build.cluster:
  kubectl .. 
build.code:
  maven ...
```

There's lots of ways to use this.  And if your service names across 2 files do not collide, you are free to put everything under exactly the same namespace.  It's only syntax, but if you choose the conventions wisely then it will probably help you to think and to read whatever you're writing.

Confused about what targets are available after using `compose.import`?  Don't forget about these special targets that can help:

```bash
# the 'help' target provided by compose.mk lists
# most targets, but not the dispatch-related ones.
make help

# the special target .services can list services per compose file
 make cluster-tools.services
 make build-tools.services
```
