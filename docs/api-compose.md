### API: compose.mk

#### API: compose.mk: (Autogenerated Targets)

The autogenerated section of the API (i.e. what's created by `compose.import`) is documented as part of the [Make/Compose Bridge](#makecompose-bridge).

#### API: compose.mk: (Static Targets)

This is the complete list of namespaces & targets available from compose.mk, along with their documentation.  Most documentation is pulled automatically from [the latest source](compose.mk).  Some important notes about how these targets work:

* **No requirements for `k8s-tools.yml` or `k8s.mk`.**
* **Most targets are pure shell, and have no exotic dependencies.** That means that they generally run fine on host or as dispatched targets inside containers.  Be mindful of these exceptions though:  targets in `stream.json.*` require `jq` and targets in `docker.*` require docker.
* **Targets are usable interactively from your shell** as `make <target>` or `./compse.mk <target>`
* **Targets are usable as an API,** either as prereq-targets or as part of the body in your targets.
* **Target names are reserved names after declaration.**

Things are organized into a few namespaces, which hopefully avoids collisions with your project targets.

* [*`io.*`* targets:](#api-io)  Misc text-formatters, timers, and other utilities
* [*`docker.*`* targets:](#api-docker) targets: Simple helpers for working with docker.
* [*`flux.*`*](#api-flux) targets: Miniature workflow library / pipe wizard.
* [*`tux.*`*  targets:](#api-tux) targets: Embedded TUI support.
* [*`stream.*`* targets:](#api-stream) targets: Support for IO streams, including basic stuff with JSON, newline-delimited, and space-delimited formats.

{% set help_extra="Docs below typically refer to `compose.mk` as the executable involved, but if you're using integrated rather than stand-alone mode, you should use `make` instead to work with your own project's context!" %}

#### API: tux

The *`tux.*`* targets allow for creation, configuration and automation of an embedded TUI interface.  See the [TUI documentation](#embedded-tui) for a high-level overview of what this is and how it works.

#### API: io

The *`io.*`* targets cover various I/O helpers, text-formatters, and other utilities.
{{macros.parse_help('compose.mk','io')}}

#### API: docker

The *`docker.*`* targets cover a few helpers for working with docker.

{{macros.parse_help('compose.mk','docker')}}

#### API: flux

The *`flux.*`* targets describe a miniature workflow library.  

Combining `flux` with [container dispatch](#container-dispatch) is similar in spirit to things like [declarative pipelines in Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-pipeline), but simpler, more portable, and significantly easier to use.  

The focus for these targets is on join/loop/map operations *over other make targets*, taking inspiration from functional programming and threading libraries.  For stuff that's more specific to shell code, see`flux.sh.*`, and for working with scripts see `flux.script.*`.  See also the [Platform Setup Example](#example-platform-setup) for a more complete walk-through of motivation/use-case.

#### API: stream

The `stream.*` targets support IO streams, including basic stuff with JSON, newline-delimited, and space-delimited formats.
