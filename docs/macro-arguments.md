### Macro Arguments

Make isn't big on named-arguments, so let's unpack the `compose.import` macro invocation.

```Makefile
include compose.mk
$(eval $(call compose.import, ▰, TRUE, docker-compose.yml))
```

 **The 1st argument for `compose.import` is called `target_namespace`**.  You can swap the unicode for `▰` out, opting instead for different symbols, path-like prefixes, whatever.  If you're bringing in services from several compose files, one way to control syntax and namespacing is to use different symbols for different calls to `compose.import`.  (For a 2-file example, see the [Multiple Compose Files](#multiple-compose-files) section.)

**The 2nd argument for `compose.import` controls whether service names are available as top-level Makefile targets.**  The only value that means True is *`TRUE`*, because Make isn't big on bool types.  Regardless of the value here, service targets are always under `<compose_file_stem>/<compose_service_name>`. 

**The last argument for `compose.import` is the compose-file to load services from.**  It will be tempting to quote this and the other arguments, but that won't work, so resist the urge!
