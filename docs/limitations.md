# Known Limitations and Issues

### KUBECONFIG should already be set 

We fake it for builds/tests, but note that **`KUBECONFIG` generally must be set for things to work!**  Sadly, lots of tools will fail even simple invocations like `helm version` or even `--help` if this is undefined or set incorrectly, and it will often crash with errors that aren't very clear.

Dealing with per-project KUBECONFIGs is best, where you can set that inside your project Makefile and be assured of no interference with your main environment.  Alternatively, use bashrc if you really want globals, or provide it directly as environment variable per invocation using something like `KUBECONFIG=.. make <target_name>`.

### Working Directories

By default, the compose file shares the working directory with containers it's using as volumes.  **This means files you're using should be inside or somewhere below the working directory!**  The compose file itself can be anywhere though, so instead of keeping it in your projects source-tree you can decide to deploy it separately to `/opt` or `~/.config`

### General Argument Passing

Unfortunately, there's not a good way to convince `make` to just proxy arguments without parsing them.  **For example `make kubectl apply -f` looks convenient, but it won't work.**  (It will instead parse `apply -f` as arguments to make.)

### Docker and File Permissions 

The usual problem with root-user-in-containers vs normal-user on host and file permissions.  The alpine base is a container using root, as are many other things.  And there is a long-standing [known bug in the compose spec](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-go/pull/299) that makes fixing this from the compose file hard.  

Invoking compose exclusively from a Makefile actually helps with this though.  By default with [compose.mk](#makefilecomposemk), `DOCKER_UID | DOCKER_GID| DOCKER_UGNAME` variables are set and available for use in [k8s-tools.yml](k8s-tools.yml).  This works slightly differently for Linux and MacOS, based on what messes things up the least, but YMMV.  With Linux, it looks something like this:

```Makefile
export DOCKER_UID?=$(shell id -u)
export DOCKER_GID?=$(shell getent group docker | cut -d: -f3 || id -g)
export DOCKER_UGNAME?=user
```

If you're not working with Makefiles at all, you can export appropriate values in .bashrc or .env files you use.  If none of this is appealing, and you mix host-local and dockerized usage of things like helm, then you may end up with weird file ownership.  You can fix this if it comes up using `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .`.  

### MacOS, Docker Sockets, and DinD

As long as docker is working, any kind of setup (Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop, Colima) should work with `compose.mk` for container-dispatch.  But for working with `k8s-tools.yml` containers specifically, the docker-socket sharing *must also be working*.  If you're having problems that might be related to this, first make sure that your setup can correctly run this command:

```bash 
$ docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -ti docker ps
```

If the volume mount is working correctly, the result here should look the same as `docker ps` from your host.  If your docker socket is in a different place (like `~/.rd/docker.sock` for Rancher Desktop), you may need to symlink the file.

MacOS Docker desktop can be especially annoying here, and it seems likely the same is true for windows.  YMMV, but as of 2024 sharing the socket may mean required changes from the UI preferences, and/or enabling/disabling virtualization backends.  If you want better parity with docker in Linux, you might like to checkout Colima/Rancher.

### Pipes & Temp Files 

Working with streaming pipes generates temporary files with `mktemp`, removing them when the process exits with `trap`.  Pure streams would be better.
