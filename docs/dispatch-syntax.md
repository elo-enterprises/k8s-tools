### Container Dispatch Syntax/Semantics

Let's look at the container-dispatch example in more detail.  This isn't a programming language you've never seen before, it's just a (legal) Makefile that uses unicode symbols in some of the targets.  

```Makefile
# A target that runs stuff inside the `debian` container, runs from host using `make demo`
demo: ▰/debian/self.demo

# Dispatching 1 target to 2 containers looks like this
demo-dispatch: ▰/debian/self.demo ▰/alpine/self.demo

# Displays platform info to show where target is running.
self.demo:
	source /etc/os-release && printf "$${PRETTY_NAME}\n"
	uname -n -v
```

The suggested defaults here will annoy some people, but the syntax is configurable, and this hopefully won't collide with existing file paths or targets.  Using the *`self`* prefix is just a convention that you can change, but having some way to guard the target from accidental execution on the host is a good idea.  This decorator-inspired syntax is also creating a convention similar to the idea of private methods: *`self`* hopefully implies internal/private, and it's not easy to type the weird characters at the command line.  So users likely won't think to call anything except `make demo`.  For people reading the code, the visual hints make it easy to understand what's at the top-level.

But what about the semantics?  In this example, the user-facing `demo` target depends on `▰/debian/demo`, which isn't really a target as much as a declaration.  The declaration means the *private* target `self.demo`, will be executed inside the `debian` container that the compose file defines.  *Crucially, the `self.demo` target can use tools the host doesn't have, stuff that's only available in the tool container.*  

Look, no `docker run ..` clutter littered everywhere!  Ok, yeah, it's still kind of a weird CI/CD DSL, but the conventions are simple and it's not locked inside Jenkins or github =)

Under the hood, dispatch is implemented by building on the [default targets that are provided by the bridge](#makecompose-bridge).
